# Supermarket Management System

## Overview

The **Supermarket Management System** is a desktop application built using Visual Basic 6.0. It simplifies the management of supermarket operations, including inventory management, sales processing, and customer management. This project utilizes `.bas`, `.cls`, `.form` files for program logic and user interface design, along with `.db` files for database storage.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**  
  Add, update, and delete products in the inventory, including details like price, stock, and category.

- **Sales Processing**  
  Process sales transactions and generate invoices for customers.

- **Customer Management**  
  Store customer details for loyalty programs and purchase tracking.

- **Reporting**  
  Generate daily, weekly, or monthly sales reports.

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure login system for admins and staff members.

## File Structure

- **`.bas` Files**  
  Contain core program logic, including utility functions and global variables.

- **`.cls` Files**

- **`.form` Files**  
  Define the graphical user interface for various components of the system, including:
  - Inventory Management
  - Sales Dashboard
  - Reports Viewer
  - Login Screen

- **`.db` File**  
  Stores the applicationâ€™s data, such as product details, sales records, and customer information.
